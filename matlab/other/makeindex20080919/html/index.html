<td> *Description*: Developed so to enable uses to quickly publish directories<br> of code and details of the cross function and global variable dependancies. <br> <br> Details<br>  <br> * Using the freely avalable grep tool this function parses m files in the<br> current directory:<br> * It will determine all the global variables used by the various files so<br> it is easy to check for overlaps of possible conflicts. <br> * It will also show which functions (scripts) are called by others and<br> which which function in this directory are called by your code. <br> * It then makes a html folder and documents subsiquently published code in an index.html file along with links to the published files.<br><br> Requirements/Usage<br>  <br> * Linux users: have grep. Windows users: download gnu grep for win32 setups, <br> <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm><br> make sure setup directory is added to the windows PATH environment variable. <br> * Place "makeindex.m" with other matlab tools or in directory added to<br> the matlab path so it can be accessed in matlab from anyway<br> * Navigate to your directory<br> * type "makeindex"<br> * You wll now have a html directory with your docuemented code in it and<br> an index.html file which shows brief details of each<br><br> *Note:* For best results and a valid desciption setup your comment in<br> your files like this one so you will have a valid description on the<br> index.html page. Also name functions the same as the m file they are in&nbsp</td><td>&nbsp</td><td>&nbsp</td><td>&nbsp</td></tr></table> <br> Created by makeindex, &copy;  Gavin Paul 2008</body></html>
